# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
In this project i want to create a program, which performs Monte Carlo Simulations for investment portfolios. It is only a project for me in order to learn how to code and the result should not be seen as a program to make predictions for real portfolios. I am using Python and will focus heavily on the mathematics rather than some GUI.
